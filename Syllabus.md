## Overview

This course considers a spectrum of anthropological and cultural investments in atmosphere, weather, and climate, at a range of scales. We focus especially on attempts at remaking, weaponizing, and enduring in altered conditions - in which atmospheric and meteorological conditions are not the passive background but a theater of transformations in which we might rethink rapidly degrading categories of the human, the environment, and the political. In doing so, we'll explore how anthropology can help us thinking about a human condition that is, inevitably, lived in the world and exposed to it. We also explore what kind of political openings modern weather could offer through the brilliant lens of ethnography. Exploring how people read the skies, seek to find shelter from a thoroughly transformed air, or aim to cope with new forms of vulnerability, we will aim to collectively develop a vocabulary for a new world, with all its dangers and delights.
